Contains code-structure layer (like CodeDOM), writer (called OutputGenerator) and CodeDOM generators (generates TypeDOM via Reflection - classes or interfaces, generates Knockout observables, WebApi proxy, etc.). \r\nIt can be easily used from T4 template or Console application, you can use it for your own generation of TypeScript code with connection to generated classes or interfaces. Many of behaviors are configurable (Naming conventions, which types to generate, etc.) and written as virtual methods.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
